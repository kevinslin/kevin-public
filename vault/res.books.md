## Summary
This is a collection of books I've read and notes I've taken on them. It was originally written without the goal of publication. It therefore might contains:

- typos
- non sequitur thinking 
- idyllic fantasies
- ideas that might be harmful to people between the ages of 1-100

You have been warned ðŸ˜‡
