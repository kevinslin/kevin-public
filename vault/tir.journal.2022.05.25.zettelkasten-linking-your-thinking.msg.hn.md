Zettelkasten was a tool designed for a very specific purpose but of late, is the proverbial hammer that is being applied to everything. As the founder of a note taking tool (dendron.so), I see lots of new users trying out PKM for the first time because they heard about zettelkastenw hen all they needed was a bullet journal instead. 

This is my first time coming across LYT - thanks for the writeup!
