I find mental models like knowledge in general - useful only if you can find the relevant entry **when needed**.
They're not useful if just collected on a shelf but ingrained into memory and lived as everyday live. 
That being said, first step of ingraining useful mental models is to write them down, hence > [[my mental models|dendron://kevin-public/me.mm]]
