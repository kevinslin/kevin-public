## Notes
been working with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for the past couple of months and just published a blog documenting the experience. tldr: using the CDK is like having cake and eating it too - cannot go back to the old ways of doing infrastructure as code

## Twitter
been working with AWS Cloud Development Kit for a few months and published a blog post documenting the experience. tldr: CDK is like having cake and eating it too and i'm afraid i can never go back.
