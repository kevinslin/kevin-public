Took my bike in for tuning (thought about personally tuning but intertia set in).
The chain has been rattling and the brakes no longer work (even after replacing the pads. )

Went to [[places.rei]] first - they wouldn't take in my bike because there was a chip in the carbon frame (which to be honest, I hadn't noticed until taking it in)

Took it to another shop whose tech said the same thing - they didn't want to be held liable if anything happend to the fork. Understandable but also frustrating. 

Options:
a) Find a frame repair shop and get the frame repaired ($600-$1k price range)
b) Swap out the frame
c) Get a new bike

For the same forces that made me take my bike to the repair shop, will probably will go with option c.
