### Fasting Blood Glucose 
- source: [[Glucose|res.glucose#^iTMnEFyrGtCqaGRU]]
- alias: FBG

- glucose levels after not having calories for 8 hours

### Insulin
- source: [[Glucose|res.glucose#^iTMnEFyrGtCqaGRU]]

- helps with glucose uptake
- also has other functions (all cells have insulin receptors)
	- eg. liver use insulin to help process glucose and fat

## Conditions

### Insulin Resistance
- source: [[Glucose|res.glucose#^iTMnEFyrGtCqaGRU]]

- potentially affects 88% of adults in the US
- symptomps
	- higher levels of insulin in blood
	- insulin doesn't work as well in certain cells
		- cells that still process insulin normally now get flooded with too much glucose
		- this is what happens in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), most common cause of infertility in woman
			- too much insulin causing ovaries to produce less estrogen
- consequence
	- heart disease
	- diabetes
	- infertility
	- Alzheimer's
- occurs when **some cells** don't respond to insulin

### Post Meal Hyperglycemia
- defined as glucose over 140mg/dl after 1-2h after a meal

### Hypoglycemia
- glucose too low
- detail
	- release epinephrine (adrenaline)
- symptoms
	- fast heart rate
	- sweating
	- anxiety
	- confusion
- long term
	- seizure
	- coma
