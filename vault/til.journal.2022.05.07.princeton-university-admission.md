## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

Princeton will no longer announce SAT averages of the incoming class to *ease student anxiety* about the admissions process.

## Thoughts
Nice in theory but if anything, will just further increase anxiety with limited information. 

Since incoming SAT scores are also something that universities use to measure against each other, Princeton is only able to do this because it is already established - see [[Nice Rich People|dendron://kevin-public/me.mm.nice-rich-people]]
