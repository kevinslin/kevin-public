## Summary

<!-- [[people._distinct.annie-durke]] -->
A guide to making better decisions. 


## Review

Annie Duke of poker fame wrote a book about decision making.

## Takeaways
- quality of decision is different from quality of outcome, good decisions do not always lead to good outcomes and vice versa (judging a decision based on outcome is known as [[res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.resulting]])
- keep a decision journal to assess accuracy of decision and avoid [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.hindisght-bias]] and [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.memory-creep]]
- three p's of judging a decision: preference, payoff and probability
- take an outside view/opinion to get beyond own filters
- to overcome analysis paralyss, figure out if you are in a [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.free-roll]] or [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.sheep-in-wolf-clothing-decision]] situation
- anticipate what might go wrong, do post a pre-mortem as well as a [[res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.backpath]]
- avoid telling people your opininon to collect untainted opinions

## Notes

### preamble
- the things that determine your life
    - your decisions and your luck
    - you can only control one of them 
- exercise: think of best and worst decisions, how do you judge them?
    - if your like most people, you judge quality of decision based on the outcome  #star

### 1 - resulting outcome 

- called outcome bias or [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts#resulting]]
    - use outcome to shortcut evaluating whether decision was good  
- four types of outcomes #ent.model #star
    - just desert: bad outcome, deserved it
    - worthy decision: good outcome, deserved it
    - bad luck: bad outcome, did not deserve it
    - dumb luck: good outcome, did not deserve it
- **watch out for bad luck and dumb luck**, makes good decision seem bad and vice versa  #star
    - even good decisions are not necessarly the best decision, always study decisions to learn from them
- anecdote: hollywood pass on star wars, was it a bad decision or a good one with bad luck?

### 2 - hindsight is not 20/20

- [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.hindisght-bias]]: believe event was predictable after it happened #star
- [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.memory-creep]]: when items after outcome makes you feel you knew things all along
    - our brains aren’t timestamped (but #dendron is)
- use knowledge tracker
    - hindsight bias causes us to lack compassion for others and ourselves,leads to  **we should have known it** syndrome
- keep a decision journal to counter this  #star

### 3 - the decision multiverse

- the paradox of experience
    - lots of experience is useful, one event is not helpful  #star
    - eg. quit and try something, it fails, will weight on you
- put individual experience in context of all other experiences
- [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.decision-forestry]] #star
    - forest massacre, before making decision, tree of possibility, afterwards, you take a cognitive chainsaw and wipe everything out, making the one thing seem inevitable
    - glue branches back on to tree to make outcome more like the twig it is then the bow it became (create decision tree)
    - explore counterfactuals

- many futures but one past, why it feels inevitable #star
    - we can counteract this by making a decision tree and exploring what could have been
    - important to **also apply this to good outcomes**

### 4 - the three ps, preference, payoff, probability

- > Step 1—Identify the reasonable set of possible outcomes. These out- comes can be general scenarios or be focused on particular aspects of the out- comes that you especially care about.
- > Step 2—Identify your preference for each outcome—to what degree do you like or dislike each outcome, given your values? These prefer- ences will be driven by the payoffs associated with each outcome. Gains com- prise the upside and losses comprise the downside. Include this information in your decision trees.
- > Step 3—Estimate the likelihood of each outcome unfolding. As a start, use common terms that express probabilities. Don’t be afraid to guess.
- > Step 4—Assess the relative likelihood of outcomes you like and dislike for the option under consideration.
- > Step 5—Repeat Steps 1–4 for other options under consideration.
- > Step 6—Compare the options to one another.
- > The above is from the PDF accompaniment of [How to Decide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51066664-how-to-decide?ref=nav_sb_ss_2_11)

- preference
    - two people can have same outcomes but different preferences
        - eg. maximize career vs family
- payoff
    - size matters
    - [[dendron://kevin-public/me.mm.asymmetric-risk]]
    - is upside worth downside?
- probability 
    - you never go in with no information,  don’t overlook territory between right and wrong
    - guess like archer, you might not hit the bulls eye but your aiming for it #word.anecdote
        - contrast this with pin the tail on the donkey where the kid has a blindfold, its just luck
    - take aim: what do you know, what can you learn to move forward #star 
- pro/con list not useful because no payoff, preference or probability

### 5 - taking aim at future: power of precision

- people have different percentages in mind with words (eg. **real possibility is can mean between 20 to 80 percent**) #star
    - get better with precision
    - aiming at target vs bulls eye
- give a range of uncertainty for estimate #star
    - make sure range isn’t too wide or narrow 
    - the shock test: would i be shocked if it’s outside of range test
    - do the shock test exercise in the book #todo
    - if i were wrong, why?

### 6 - turning decisions outside in

- it’s easier to solve other peoples problems #star
    - we are over confident in our own beliefs
    - our own circumstances filter everything 

- some filters
    - confirmation bias
    - disconfirmation bias 
    - recency bias
    - illusion of control
    - availability bias

- everything strengthens your own believes
    - you aim to protect your own beliefs
- **inside view vs outside view**, outsider helpful, diff conclusion with same set of facts #star
    - eg 
        - friend that always dates jerks, maybes it’s them 
        - 90% professors think they’re above average, most people think they are good drivers
        - 50% end in divorce, 5% have prenuptial agreement  #ent.eg
- harder to see outside view when you are smart 

- what is true in general, outside of anyone's views? this is base rate 
    - see to actively find out what other people know 
    - people avoid disagreeing because they don't want to hurt your feelings but this actively harms you 
        - eg. spinach in your teeth, people are unkind to not tell you

- start with outside view and then inside view 
    - marry the two narratives

### 7 - analysis paralysis 

- base decision on payoff
- if decision repeats, easier to go fast #star
- [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.free-roll]]: low downside 
- watch out for [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.free-donut]]: lottery ticket 
- [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.sheep-in-wolf-clothing-decision]]: all options are close
    - test: if this were the only option, would you go with it? if so, then do it
- some other factors
    - consider cost of quitting
        - sometimes its worth it to quit
    - exercise options in parallel
        - more expensive but you get to sample multiple outcomes
    - if you want to do research, do you have information that you can get that would change your mind? #star

### 8 - power of negative thinking 

- [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.behavior-gap]]: what we believe and what we do

- techniques
    - mental contrasting: figure out what might go wrong and what to do
    - [[dendron://kevin-public/me.techniques.pre-mortem]]
    - [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.backpath]]: how to succeed
    - pre-commitment, [[dendron://kevin-public/res.books.how-to-make-better-decision.concepts.ulysses-contrac]]: heighten or lower barriers to do something
    - dr evil: death by a thousand cuts, give a rational sounding reason to not get closer to your goal
    - categorical decision: make a decision that rules out other decisions (eg. i will avoid meat vs i'm vegan) #star
    - tilting: making bad worse, plan for this
    - hedging: control bad luck 

### 9 - decision hygiene 

- if you tell people your opinion, they tend to agree #star
    - avoid doing this
- study with visual test of card with three lines, two of which which are clearly not the same length
    - in one room, planted confederates who said all lines were equal
    - over 30% of test participants went with confederates #ent.eg
