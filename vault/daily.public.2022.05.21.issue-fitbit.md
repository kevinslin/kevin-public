### Context
My wife's fitbit wasn't pairing and she asked me to take a look 

### Look for fitbit sense issue
- query: connecting to fitibit + fitbit sense + stuck
- restuls:
    - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253234393
    - https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sense/Sense-stuck-in-setup/td-p/4692494
        > Instead, I went into the phone app settings and began to just change things sort of randomly with the Fitbit app.  After changing the battery setting to never power save, and manually editing all of the connectivity permissions to be allowed, it was finally able to pair with the phone.

### Tried
- unpairing and re-pariing
- turning everything off and back on
- factory reset fitbit via https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/how-to-reset-fitbit-6808 #solved
