## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

The federal reserve was supposed to a shock absorber that helped normalize the market. Instead, it has become an accelerant, trying to push market growth by aggressively lowering interest rates and "quantitative easing" (aka printing money).

## Thoughts

An alternative title could be *Monetary policy and the not-so-invisible-hand. 

Anyone that says the west is a *free market* economy never takes into account the encyclopedia of caveats (free speech is similar).
