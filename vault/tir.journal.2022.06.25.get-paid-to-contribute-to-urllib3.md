## Thoughts

Bounties for open source. Its been tried a bunch with mixed results but the model itself has never really taken off. 

Ultimately, if you want to get paid for work, you work at FANG. If you want to feel good about contributing, you do it for free.

Paying open source contributors for bounties is like paying your significant other for sex.
