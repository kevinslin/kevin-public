# Summary

## 1 what is crucial conversation
- strong emotions
- opinions very
- stakes high

- key to change is not changing a process but getting people to hold each other accountable to processes (eg. commitment vs compliance)
- bunch of examples of how crucial conversations save money

## 2 mastering crucial conversation
- break past fool choice, you can win argument or you will lose friend, if you do it right, you can do both
- be good at **filling pool of shared meaning**, we're all on the same playing field, make safe for everyone to talk

## 3 start with heart
- start with right motives and stay focused
- before conversation
    - **ask what do you really want** (for yourself, for others, for the relationship)
        - how would i behave if this is what I want?
        - clarify what you don't want
    - don't make fool choices, find the 'and'
        - eg: it's either my integrity or the other guys reputation
        - ask, what do i want for myself, the other person and the relationship?
    - eg:
        - what I want: for my husband to stop making commitments that he doesn't keep
        - what i don't want: for conversation to turn heated and waste our time
        - and: can i have candid conversation about being more dependable and avoid creating bad feelings or wasting our time
- when we're under attack, we forget about goal and think about winning, crushing the opponent or keeping the peace by avoiding the hard topics

## 4 learn to look
- notice cues for crucial conversation
    - physical
    - emotions
    - behavioral
- its not about content but about safety, watch out if safety is at risk
- **conversation turns crucial once people no longer feel safe**
    - leads to silence (not speaking up) or violence (force meaning)
    - silence
        - masking: being sarcastic or flippant, eg: your idea is amazing. people can't appreciate its genius
        - avoiding: eg. you want to cut costs? we can always get cheaper coffee
        - withdrawing: eg. i gotta go
    - attacking:
        - controlling: make others go your way
            - eg: no sane person would choose to go this way
        - labelling: dismiss ideas under a stereotype
            - eg: only people who didn't know what they were talking about would say this
        - attacking: eg: do that again and there will be consequences
- figure out you style under stress

- quiz:
    - 1/t, 2/t, 3/f, 4/t, 5/t, 6/t, 7/t, 8/t, 9/f, 10/t, 11/f, 12/f, 13/t, 14/t, 15/t, 16/t, 17/t, 18/t, 19/t, 20/t, 21/t, 22/t, 23/t, 24/t, 25/f, 26/t, 27/t, 28/t, 29/f, 30/t, 31/t, 32/f, 33/t

- ! masking, 1
- avoiding, 0.5
- ! withdraw, 1
- ! controlling, 1
- labeling, 0.5
- attacking, 0
- ! 3 heart, 1/3
- 4 learn to look, 2/3
- 5 make it safe, 2/3
- 6 master stories, 1/3
- 7 state path, 1/3
- 8 explore other path, 3/3
- 9 action, 1/3

## 5 make it safe
- notice if conversation isn't safe
- make sure there's a mutual purpose, common goal
    - know this isn't the case if there is a debate

## 6 master my stories

## 7 STATE
- STATE
    - share facts
    - tell story
    - ask for other path
    - talk tentatively
    - encourate testing
- eg:
    - share: i feel defensive when you say that this doesn't work
    - tell story: it feels like we have no hope for the project. i'm put up a face with everyone else but i don't want to do it with you. what do you think? i think we're on same page. what if we tried focusing on stories?

- people become defensive, contrast
    - eg: You know I care about you. I just don't think I'm in that state right now

- learn to look
    - when do people start resisting
    - eg: raise volume?

- when you feel strong about your idea, you're not looking to expand the shared pool of meaning
    - instead, use attacking techniques to get your way

- Don’t pile it on. Sometimes we lack the confidence to speak up, so we let problems simmer for a long time. Given the chance, we generate a whole arsenal of unflattering conclusions.

### ask for other paths
- We mentioned that the key to sharing sensitive ideas is a blend of confidence and humility.
- So once you’ve shared your point of view—facts and stories alike—invite others to do the same. If your goal is to keep expanding the pool of meaning rather than to be right, to make the best decision rather than to get your way, then you’ll willingly listen to other views. By being open to learning we are demonstrating humility at its best.

### talk tenativel


- Too soft: “This is probably stupid, but . . .” 
- Too hard: “How come you ripped us off?” 
- Just right: “It’s starting to look like you’re taking this home for your own use. Is that right?”

### encourage testing

- how you phrase your invitation makes a big difference. Not only should you invite others to talk, but you have to do so in a way that makes it clear that no matter how controversial their ideas might be, you want to hear them.
- Safety becomes particularly important when you’re having a crucial conversation with people who might move to silence. Some people make Fool’s Choices in these circumstances. They worry that if they share their true opinions, others will clam up.
- Make sure they have the opportunity to share by actively inviting them to do so: “Does anyone see it differently?” “What am I missing here?” “I’d really like to hear the other side of this story.”
- Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view. “Maybe I’m wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because . . .”

### STRONG BELIEF

- In the end, nobody is listening, everyone is committed to silence or violence, and the Pool of Shared Meaning remains parched and tainted.

### How Did We Get Like This? 

It starts with a story. When we feel the need to push our ideas on others, it’s generally because we believe we’re right and everyone else is wrong.

We feel justified in using dirty tricks. Once we’re convinced that it’s our duty to fight for the truth, we start pulling out the big guns. We use debating tricks that we’ve picked up throughout the years. Chief among them is the ability to “stack the deck.”

## 8 Explore other paths
- AMPP:
    - ask
    - mirror
    - paraphrase
    - prime
        - state what other person might be thinking and take a guess

- for repeat offenders, don't talk about latest incident but the pattern
- emotions feel "true" during crucial conversations but are actually false
