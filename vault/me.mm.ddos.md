> In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

While DDoS usually refer to digital attacks on digital targets, another form of such an attack occurs psychologically on humans. Any person that has ever been baited by a troll or spent an inordinate amount of time mulling over something that was said about them on the internet has been subject to a psychological ddos.
