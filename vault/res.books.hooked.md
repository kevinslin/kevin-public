## Summary

{{fm.author}} goes into building habit forming products

## Review

Lots of actionable advice. This book + [[The Lean Startup|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup]] are probably going to be enough to bootstrap most ideas to profitability. 

## Takeaways
- habits are built on existing desires, must occur with certain frequency/utility
- hooked model: trigger -> action -> variable reward -> investment 
- habits come from avoiding pain or gaining pleasure
- easier to increase user ability to accomplish a habit than increase user motivation
- to make a habits, variable reward must be paired with investment to complete the flywheel

## Key Points

### habits
- actions must cross certain frequency/utility threshold to become a habit ([[Habit Zone|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.hooked.concepts.habit-zone]])

### trigger
- a feeling that turns into an action
- habits are not created but built on (eg. pleasure/pain, hope/fear, acceptance/rejection)
- 4 types of triggers: paid, earned, relationship, owned

### action
- B = MAT (behavior = motivation * ability * trigger)
- to make habits stick, either increase motivation or ability, motivation is harder to increase then ability, hence better to focus on simplifying the product

### variable reward
- novelty causes attention
- novelty comes from tribe (social media), hunt (gain), or self (growth)

### investment
- flywheel where product becomes more useful over time
- after variable reward because people are primed to invest after getting something

## Notes

### intro
- triggers will start a behavior

### 1 - the habit zone
- for something to become a habit, must help gain pleasure or avoid pain
    - habit is intersection of frequency and utility
- habits cannot form outside of habit zone (frequency and utility)

### 2 - trigger
- habits not created but built upon
- trigger has cue for what to do next
- negative emotion very powerful trigger for habit
- once habit is formed, feeling -> action
- 4 types of triggers: paid, earned, relationship, owned

### 3 - action
- B = MAT (behavior = motivation * ability * trigger)
- humans are motivated by 3 things
    - pleasure/pain
    - hope/fear
    - acceptance/rejection
- motivation vs ability, hard to increase motivation, focus on making it easier 
- some tips for simplifying (heuristics)
    - scarcity, framing, endowed progress, 
- timing - make sure trigger is present when motivation arises
- ability influenced by:
    - **time**, money, physical effort, **brain cycles**, social deviance, and **non-routine**

### 4 - variable reward
- variable rewards add novelty to product that makes humans pay attention
- 3 types of variable rewards
    - the tribe: social reward (so points)
    - the hunt: material resource (ebay)
    - the self: intrinsic reward (fitness)
- make sure user has autonomy when designing variable reward process

### 5 - investment
- investment = anticipation of future reward
    - happens after variable reward phase because users are now primed to reciprocate 
- investment continues because
    - we value our efforts (more effort in past, more future effort)
    - we want to be consistent with past behavior (do what we've always done)
    - we avoid cognitive dissonance (rationalize our choices)
- makes service better the more it is used
    - store value in form of 
        - content
        - data
        - followers
        - reputation
        - skill

### 6 - what are you going to do with this
- building responsible behaviors
    - 4 quadrants: 
        - facilitator: would use product, believe that it makes peoples lives better
        - peddler: would not use product, believe that it makes peoples lives better
        - entertainer: would use product, does not believe that it makes peoples lives better
        - dealer: would not use product, does not believe that it makes peoples lives better
    - be a facilitator
