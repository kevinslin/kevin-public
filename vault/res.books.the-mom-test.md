## Notes

### The Mom Test

- dont tell customers about your idea, ask about their problems #star
- measure for usefulness: gather **concrete facts about customer habits and world views**
- figure out if the **problem matters**

- generic answers: counter with specific examples
- dig in to interesting or unexpected answer
- **get more specific**: what parts do they love/hate?
- workarounds: how do they solve X? how much do they pay for it? whats the budget?
- does it matter? what happened the last time a customer encountered a problem? why are they not solving it?

### Avoiding bad data
- 3 types: 
    - compliments
    - fluff (generics, hypotheticals, future)
    - ideas

- compliments: avoid by not pitching your idea
    - if you did, get details:
        - why do they like the idea?
        - how much money would it save them?
        - how would it fit into their life?
        - what else have they tried?

- fluff 
    - generics: I usually/always/never
    - future tense: I would/will
    - hypothetical: I might/could
- watch out for fluff-inducing questions (eg. do you ever, would you ever, etc)
    - get concrete, **anchor to past behavior**
        - when is the last time that happened?
        - what have you done in the past?
- **watch out for complainers**: people that talk fluff but don't actually do anything about the problem

- digging into feature requests 
    - understand request
        - “Why do you want that?” 
        - “What would that let you do?” 
        - “How are you coping without it?” 
        - “Do you think we should push back the launch to add that feature, or is it something we could add later?” 
        - “How would that fit into your day?” 
    - understand emotion
        - “Tell me more about that.” 
        - “That seems to really bug you — I bet there’s a story here.” 
        - “What makes it so awful?” 
        - “Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?” 

- avoid approval seeking
    - If you’ve mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings 

### Asking important questions
- ask a question that could destroy your business

- if you get a weak signal, don't try to pitch on the idea but move on
    - dig into details of why signal is lukewarm
        - is problem not a big deal?
        - is it the wrong persona type?
        - does customer not care for the specific implementation?
        - did customer hear too many pitches?
    - don't zoom in until you have a strong signal
- plan 3 most important things you want to learn for each persona type
    - choose whatever is the most murkiest to start asking about

### Keeping it casual
- interview in 3 meetings
    1. learn about customer and problem
    2. talk about solution
    3. make a sell
- first interview should be casual and can be done in under 5min
    
### Commitment and advancement

> If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless

- interviews sholud lead to
    - commitment: lead is willing to give something of value (time, reputation, money)
    - advancement: moving closer to purchasing
- not getting outcome is usually because
    - you're looking for compliments
    - you're not asking for a clear commitment
- commitments
    - intro to peers
    - alpha user
    - case study
- goal of early sales is **learning**

### Finding conversations
- spend time teaching
    - eg. conferences, workshops, online videos, blogging, free consulting, office hours
- organize a conference or knowledge exchange group
- talk to professors for intros
- Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask
    - VISION: what are you doing?
    - FRAMING: what stage are you at?
    - WEAKNESS: why do you need help? what do you need answers on?
    - PEDESTRAL: why is this person the right person to help you?
    - ASK: ask your questions

### Choosing your customers
- if you're not finding consistent problems/goals, you don't have a customer segment
- segment is who/where pair
    - eg. finance professionals, age 225-35, living in a major city, that live in london, are training for a marathon, and go to the gym during their lunch hour
- should find people you admire/enjoy being around
- you should not be talking to everyone

### Running the process
- prep, review, take notes
- have your list of 3 big questions
- have existing set of beliefs that you are updating
- spend up to an hour doing a best guess about the person you'll be talking to and what they care about
- things to note down
	- ☇ Pain or problem (symbol is a lightning bolt) 
	- ⨅ Goal or job-to-be-done (symbol is a soccer/football goal) 
	- ☐ Obstacle 
	- ⤴ Workaround 
	- ^ Background or context (symbol is a distant mountain)
