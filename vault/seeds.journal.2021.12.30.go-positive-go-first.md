## Notes

- start a favor to smaller favor , (say no to first thing - give blood for two years, then ask for smaller)

- we like to say yes to people like us
- find common points of interest 
- tell people you like them

- social proof, show that something is popular
- menus in restaurants, show asterix for popular items make them more popular
- float testimonials at the top

- loss aversion
- MW: never lose a note again 

- commitment consistency
- ask “will you do X”
- fight against this: here’s some new information. not your fault you made commitment on bad data

- point to shared tribes
- eg. i’m a student here too. would you like to do X?
