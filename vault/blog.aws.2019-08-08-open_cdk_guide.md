![AWS Cloud Development Kit Guide Representation](https://kevinslin-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/20190808-cdk_guide-conv.jpg)

Over the past year, I've been following the development of the [AWS CloudDevelopment Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) (CDK) - a framework built on top of CloudFormation that makes it delightful for users to manage AWS [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) (IaC).

This has been my favorite release of AWS in 2019 in a year of many exciting releases - [SCP Conditionals](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/03/service-control-policies-enable-fine-grained-permission-controls/), [Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-security-hub-now-generally-available/), [Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/06/aws-control-tower-is-now-generally-available/), and [EC2 Resource Optimization Recommendations](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/07/introducing-amazon-ec2-resource-optimization-recommendations/) just to name a few.

When everything is going right, the CDK will make you feel like a devops wizard. That being said, the cloud is complicated, CloudFormation coverage of AWS is incomplete, and the CDK itself (and IaC in general) is still a young framework with little in the way of established best practices. You can see my past article [[here|blog.aws.2019-06-12-cdk_all_the_things]] for a more in depth dive into the CDK.

This is why, after having many repeated discussions about aforementioned best practices, I'm happy to announce the [Open CDK Guide](https://github.com/kevinslin/open-cdk). This guide is a collections of learnings and best practices around all things CDK. It is meant to be a living document, updated on an ongoing basis by the community as the CDK and practices around it mature.

Feedback and contributions welcome :)
