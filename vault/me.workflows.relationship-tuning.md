## Context

This is something I practice with my wife. Originally heard from an episode of [[res.podcasts.tim-ferris]].

## Details

Every two weeks, me and my wife will sit down and do a retrospective of the past two weeks. It follows the following structure:

- Together:
    - what did we do well in

- Individual:
    - What did I do well in
    - What did you do well in
    - What could I improve on
    - What could you improve on

We have an airtable that tracks every tuning session we've had since the start of our marriage. While this hasn't always been easy, it gives both of us a space to talk about things that would be otherwise uncomfortable to bring up. Instead of letting issues fester, we talk about them.
