### Notes
- you see the world not as it is but as you are #quote
- sometimes it’s right hit a fly with a sledgehammer #quote
- do the work, is this true, do i know this is true, what if this weren’t true
- turnarounds

- effortlessly state
  - state
  - action
  - results 

- focus on what you have, you gain what you lack. if you focus on what you lack, you lose what you have  #quote

- after X I will do Y
  - if i complain, i do X

- it’s all so simple
