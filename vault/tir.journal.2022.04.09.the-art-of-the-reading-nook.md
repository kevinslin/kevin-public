## Summary

Goes over reading nooks - a dedicated spaces to spend time reading and how the pandemic has made them come back

## Notes

I like the idea of having dedicated spaces in general. Ever since I started working remotely (this was pre-covid), something that I'm religious about is having dedicated spaces for work and not-work. 

In general, the larger idea is to be purposeful in action - dedicated spaces help by creating ritual around this.

One reason its hard to concentrate today is because of the mobile phone - it's an easy out of whatever current situation currently exists. You can fill any space and any minute with an infinite source of entertainment and curiosities. This is powerful but its powerful in the same way that the `goto` statement is powerful - it should be used with care.

Instead, we're sprinkling it on everything and everyone.
