## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

## Notes
From the creator of nodejs, Deno is the reincarnation of everything that [[people.figure.ryan-dahl]] wanted to do better the second time around.

## Thoughts
While not having used [[lang.deno]] in a real project, I'm generally supportive of trying to unify webby-js and regular-js. 

Not a fan of the whole esm + cjs debacle and the (lack of) migration that is happening the js ecosystem but that is a different story altogether

Open source projects with managed hosting has become quite the popular recipe in the age of SaaS - vercel + next, gatsby + gatsby cloud + ghost + maaged ghost, etc

This is the first time (that I know of) where a programming language is backed by a VC with a (maybe) business ~~model~~ proposition. Will be monitoring to see how this develops
