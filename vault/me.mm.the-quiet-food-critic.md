In the restaurant business, they say that its the quiet ones you need to watch out for because they will dislike something about your food, say nothing, and never come back.

## #thoughts

Given the choice between a quiete critic and a loud one, I would always prefer the latter (assuming they have valid concerns). I would go as far as saying that the latter is performing a public service - both to the restaurant and to future patrons. 

For the restaurant because they are getting feedback about their food and have a chance to make things right, and for future patrons because they are now being warned if not.

Unless you are a troll, there is both social stigma and a cost associated to your person when you leave negative feedback, especially publically. But for the person that is leaving honest negative feedback, they are doing a great service, often with no benefit to themselves (asides fron ranting).
