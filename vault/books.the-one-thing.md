# Summary
Gary shares the value of simplifying life and business down to focusing on one thing

# Review
The book, fitting enough, is about one thing - focusing on one thing to achieve extrodinary results. It's a good takeaway.

# Takeaway
- what is the one thing I can do that will make all other things easier or unecessary

# ToC
- 1. The One Thing
- 2. The Domino Effect
- 3. Success Leaves Clues
- Part I
    - everything matters equally
    - multitasking
    - a diciplined life
    - willpower is always on will-call
    - a balanced life
    - big is bad
- part II
    - the focusing question
    - the success habit
    - the path to great answers
- part III
    - live with purpose
    - live by priority
    - live for productivity
    - the three commitments
    - the four thieves
    - the journey
    - putting it to work

# Key Points
- great performance is result of habits
- ask large and specific question to get results
    - eg. what is something I can do do 10x revenue by end of this quarter?
    - better than small and specific or large and unspecific
- block your time to get things done

# Quotes
- too slow to notice and then too fast to stop

# Analogies
- life is like a postage stamp. stick to one thing until you get there
- domino effect: one thing can knock over something that is 50% bigger

# Notes
- 6 lies
    - everything matters equally
    - build habits vs have discipline, focus on one habit a day, 66 days
- think big
- focus question: one thong i can do that will help everything else or make it unnecessary
    - every day, what is one thing i can do to X
    - large and specific question
- block your time
- watch out for four thieves
