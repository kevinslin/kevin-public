### Notes
- talking to strangers can be rewarding because theres so little expectations #MW
- you forget other people are human sometimes in cities because there are so many people and you view them more as obstacles
- something as small as a smile or a compliment is all it takes to make both parties get a connection

### Notes
- heard story from [[people.ilana-lin]] about *decency police* that break up couples in parks, makes more sense in context of this #MW
- there are certain things that always get me - the scale of the cosmos and the disparity in incomes #MW
