## Notes
- emotional landscape #word.phrase
- what was destiny is now a decision #word.phrase
- there are things in life that can't be evaluated in a spreadsheet, eg. love, having a kid, etc
- the terror of war is not knowing when its going to end #mw(running a startup can be like this - there is no finish line) #word.anecdote
- we want a texture to our lives (eg. religion, marriage, parenthood)
