## Notes

* This video was recorded for the future founder track in Startup School 2020.

* First, I'm going to discuss the most common mistakes founders make when coming up with startup ideas
* Then, I'm going to talk about how to evaluate startup ideas
* I'm going to talk about recipes for generating startup ideas

* first, most common mistake is believing that you need an amazing idea to get started
  * But I can tell you it only looks that way in hindsight. When Google started, it was, like, the 20th search engine. And when Facebook started, it was, like, the 20th social network.

* The next mistake is exactly the opposite: jumping into the first idea that comes to mind, without really stopping to think critically about whether it's a good idea at all
  * Here's the thing. If your startup is successful, you will spend years of your life working on it. And if you're going to spend years of your life working on something, wouldn't it make sense to spend, say, at least a couple of weeks first, deciding what to work on?
  * Startup ideas morph over time. Take Airbnb, for example. Airbnb was initially literally a website for renting air beds

* The third mistake is to start with a solution instead of a problem
  * So, imagine you come up with a startup idea "Uber for plumbers." It's an app, you push a button, a plumber shows up. This is a solution. What problem does this solve? I don't know

* The last mistake is believing that startup ideas are hard to find. Actually, they're easy to find, because there are many, many real problems left in the world. If you're having trouble finding them, it's just that you haven't yet learned how to do it.

### Evaluating ideas
* Let's talk about evaluating startup ideas. I'm actually going to give you a formula

* This formula comes from my colleague, Dalton, who has an excellent Startup School talk called "All About Pivoting," which I really recommend.

* evaluate your idea on four criteria, and then you take the average of the scores.

* The first criteria is how big is this idea? 
  - The best way to judge this, I think, is to look for existing large companies that do something similar.
* Founder/market fit. This is like, are the founders experts in what they're doing?
- how sure are you that you're solving a big problem? 
  - Ideally, you have personal experience with this proble
* And finally, do you have a new, important insight into this idea? 
  - And a great example of this is Airbnb. When Airbnb got started, most people thought that the idea of allowing strangers you met on the internet to sleep in your apartment was really weird, and probably dangerous. But the Airbnb founders had actually tried this. They'd invite strangers from the internet to stay with them, and they realized it was really fun

* Here are some other signs to look for that your idea is probably a good one
  * you're making something you personally want to have
  * his only recently became possible
    - If something recently changed in the world, like a new technology or a new product you can build on top of, that's often a sign that a new opportunity has been created

### Filters
* My last topic about evaluating startup ideas is to talk about filters. Filters are bad reasons to reject startup ideas. And the most dangerous part of filters is that they will cause you to reject your best startup ideas unconsciously

* The first is rejecting ideas that seem hard to get started. Paul Graham wrote a terrific article about this, called "Schlep Blindness," which I really recommend reading
  * And the fascinating thing about Stripe is that when Stripe launched, there were thousands of developers who already knew that this was a problem. They had tried to integrate credit card payments to their site, and they realized that the existing options sucked. But not one of them tried to fix it. Why is that? The reason is that to start Stripe, you had to do a bunch of things that seemed difficult
  * The second filter is ideas that are in a boring space. And a great example of this is Gusto, which makes payroll software. There were, once again, thousands of programmers who must have realized that payroll software sucked, but because it was a boring problem, nobody tried to fix it
  * the third one is ideas that seem too ambitious. Sam Altman wrote an excellent blog post on this, called "Hard Startups." Founders instinctively shy away from really ambitious-sounding ideas because they are intimidating. But often, these are the ideas that turn into really big companies
  * The last one is that founders instinctively shy away from spaces where there are existing competitors. You should actually err on the side of doing things with existing competitors. When founders go into spaces with no existing competitors, they usually find out that the reason there are no competitors is because nobody wants the product

### Having Ideas
* The best way to have startup ideas is to notice them organically

* If you're planning to start a startup way in the future, it's very helpful to become an expert on something valuable, and the best way is probably to get a job at the forefront of some field.

* seven recipes for explicitly generating startup ideas

* This first recipe is the best one
  * You start with what your team is especially good at, and think of ideas that you would have an unfair advantage in executing. The reason this is so effective is that any idea you come up with this way has automatic founder/market fit
  * The first thing I do is I go through every company you've ever worked at. Internships are fine. And for each one, I'd ask yourself what are things you learned there that other people don't know? So, for example, SnapDocs. The founder of SnapDocs, Aaron, had worked in the mortgage industry for 10 years, and learned, like, everything about it. So he started SnapDocs, which builds software for managing mortgage paperwork
  * Then, ask yourself, for each company, what seemed broken? What parts of company life were clumsy? For example, Lattice is a company that makes software for performance reviews. And the way the founders had this idea is that they worked at a company together, and they noticed how bad their performance review software was
  * Then ask yourself if there were things that your company built in-house that other companies might need. A good example of this is Mixpanel. Before Suhail started Mixpanel, he worked at a company called Slide, that had built advanced analytics tools for internal projects

* Second recipe, think of things you wish someone else would build for you. 
  - A great example of this is DoorDash. The DoorDash founders were trying to get Thai food delivered to them in the suburbs, and they realized there was literally no way to do it.

* Third recipe. What would you be excited to work on for 10 years, even if it didn't succeed? 
  - What things are you really passionate about? A great example of this is Boom, which is making a supersonic airplane

* Number four, look for things that have changed in the world recently, and think of ideas that are now possible because of this change
  * A maybe non-obvious example of this is a YC company called PlanGrid, which was acquired for a billion dollars. PlanGrid put construction blueprints on tablets, replacing paper. And what changed in the world that made PlanGrid possible was that Apple had created the iPad

* Number five, find companies that have been successful recently, and look for new variants of them. 
  - A good example of this is Standard Cognition
  * Standard Cognition realized that every retail store would want the same technology, and that's what they do.

* Number six, you can also crowdsource coming up with an idea by talking to people you know, and asking them for problems they want solved. 
  - This is especially interesting to do with people who have particular areas of expertise, like people who work in an interesting industry, for example

* And, number seven. Look for industries that seem broken. Any industry that seems broken is probably ripe for disruption
  * YC company called LendUp, which is a replacement for payday lending. And part of the founding story of LendUp is that the founders just noticed that payday lending was an obviously broken and scammy industry
