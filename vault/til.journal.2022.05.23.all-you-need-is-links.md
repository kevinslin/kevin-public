## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

Using only links, its possible to reconstruct all other forms of structure in the tools of thought space. 

A folder is just a list of links. A tag is just a list of links. Comments can be links. Triplets can be links. Everything can be a link. 

## Thoughts

Simple systems that come together to create complex behavior are generally more resillient than complex systems that create complex behavior. 

This plays out a lot in technology. RISC vs BASIC, C++ vs Go, etc. 

Sometimes though, complexity is needed (eg. Rust). Sometimes it is not (eg. Angular). 

There's always a balance to be struck but when in doubt, favor simple systems that be composed to create more complicated behavior. 

It would be interesting to see how far we could build a system that was just links. And what the limits are. 

CSS3 and Rust are both turing complete - I would not want to do coding with CSS3
