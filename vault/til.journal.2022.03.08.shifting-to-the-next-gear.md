## Summary

## Notes

- average not useful, eg. jeff beeps walks into bar with 100 customer, average net worth a billion 

- race car driver, you need to accelerate at apex of curve, not at the end, lose too much momentum
    - how to watch out for curves
        - gross revenue retention and net revenue retention
        - retention health help you find curves in the road
- divide retention health by segments, products, usages, etc

- watch what your customers do vs say #star
    - eg. 
        - quick books, customers said they wanted budgeting but didn’t use it when ship
        - they don’t have time
        - watch behavior, they get overwhelmed trying to match outstanding receipts
        - build a task management solution instead
- fall in love with problem, not the solution #star

- pricing: align price with value delivered
    - more value should be more price

- pyramid to pricing
    - 1: what drives value, pricing metric 
    - 2: packaging, turn what you build to what you sell, what customer segment are you selling to
    - 3: price, align price to value by customer segment 


- design end to end customer experience
    - eg. if your friend had this experience, would you be happy about it?

- start with the customer
    - what is your promise to them?
    - how do they realize value?
    - how do they become successful?
