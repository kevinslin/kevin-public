This describes my personal Dendron setup. I have the following vaults:

- kevin-public: public digital garden
- kevin-private: daily journals, personal projects, etc
- kevin-blog: blog posts
- notes: catch all for everything. docs on popular services
- people: keep track of people that are important to me

## On Projects

Every project that I create, I create a corresponding entry in my personal [[Project|proj]] hierarchy 

## On Work
