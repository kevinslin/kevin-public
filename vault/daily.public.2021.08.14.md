Terrible title. Don't overoptimize the greedy strategy for life - you don't have enough information. I would caveat that the examples of clipping coupons used in this article are *micro-greedy* optimizations. Like micro-agressions, I think these acts are not worth the time.

General *greedy* algorithms of doing the best thing you can without complete information is one that I whole heartidly subscribe to.

There are multiple sides to every story but generally, downvote. Scientific authority doesn't mean much in post-trump America. I can see how as a farmer you might hate wolves. And its easy for a city person who grew up watching animal planet to hate these farmers.
