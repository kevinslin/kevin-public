## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

## Notes
- terraform was flatline for first 2 years before growing (investors wondered if it was the right idea)

- we knew that provisioning infra was a problem but was what we were building the solution?
- need **tastemakers** we could trust
  - didn't have many customers but customers were big (eg. ebay)

- hard to sell iac when people didn't know what iac was, explained it as "simplifying your automation"
