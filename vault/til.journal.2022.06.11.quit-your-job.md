If you're reading this, chances are that the statement above holds true. Why is it hard to leave what we're doing even when we have the means and the *privilege* to do so?
Progress is deceptive, when all else is uncertain, the accumulation of wealth is at the very least a standard in which everyone understands. It is a hedge against all else that life might throw at you. 

But wealth without purpose is like fuel without an engine. It just ends up being stored and occasional causes an oil leak. 

If we have the *privilege* to choose what we do, then we also have the *comsmic duty* to do so. The path to choosing might require exploration and novelty (aka *active unemployment* or *leisure*). This uncertainty feels like a luxury because of the opportunity cost. It is easy to measure this cost in terms of dollars and job titles. This is tangible and is what holds us in place. But does any of this matter if its not towards living a meaningful life?

Build your empire. Find your calling. Until you have a basis to start from, nothing else matters.
