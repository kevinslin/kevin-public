Instead of trying to beat the news cycles and stay up to date, I try to give items some time to boil before reading. 

My reading workflow:
- go through various RSS feeds using [[Feedly|dendron://kevin-public/me.setup.feedly]] and save articles I want to read for later
- on any given day, don't read items from the day but items that have been saved from previous days

The rationale behind this is because my monkey brain goes for clickbaitey titles and wants immediate gratification. By giving things some time to settle, it gives [[System Two|dendron://kevin-public/me.mm.system-one-and-two]] a chance to step in (and remove articles before I read them). 

A similar trick works when shopping for items you're not sure you'll need - instead of doing an impulse buy, come back in a week and see if you still need said item.
