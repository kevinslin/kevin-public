Invest in the inputs. 
Instead of basing your projects and priorities around goals that might require outputs beyond your control, invest in systems that will help you win over the long term regardless of what the result it.

Accomplishing goals require the draining of "passion" or "willpower", both of which are finite. By building systems that will continually build you up, you save your limited mental resources to focus on the hard things
