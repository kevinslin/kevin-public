## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

Some amount of slack is needed for people to function effectively and this goes against the grain of productivity maxinism which tries to squeeze something in for every empty spot on the calendar

## Thoughts

I agree. But its hard to do in practice. Even if not doing it ends badly, not doing it could also not be an option.
