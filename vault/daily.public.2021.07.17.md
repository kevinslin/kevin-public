### 1. [[Continuous Glucose Monitoring|proj.2021-07-continuous-glucose-monitoring]]

While not diabetic, I used to be a big [[quantified self|r.thing.quantified-self]] person until I realized I wasn't actually doing anythign with my data. Now after a few years of hiatus, I find myself slowly getting back to tracking things again. 

I recently got a subscription to [[Levels Health|r.thing.levels-health]] which helps people track their [[glucose|r.glucose]] through a continuous glucose monitor.

Below is my reading for this day. As you can see, I have some high spikes after every meal. Will be working on getting this down over the next couple of weeks.
