## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

People on internet upset because overfunded indie game that is many years late is working on "bedsheet deformation" physics. 

- NOTE: This is not some sort einstein relativity thing but literally AI characters getting in bed and deforming sheets kind of things. 

## Thoughts

Prioritization is hard. But not this hard. Deadlines and constraints are ultimately the catalyst for all things. Star Citizen might have been a much better game if it had raised far less money and really focused on one thing
