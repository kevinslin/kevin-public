## Summary

Eric Ries breaks down the "lean startup methodology", a process in which to come up with, execute and grow an idea from just that to a successful business.

## Review

Clear, actionable and effective ways of starting a new venture.

## Takeaways
- don't assume, measure
- be explicit about value and growth assumptions and then build-measure-learn
- progress should be measured with [[Validated Learning|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#validated-learning]]

## Key Points

- what is startup
	- a [[Startup|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#startup]] tries to build something in extreme uncertainty
	- a startup tends to be based on a [[Leap of Faith Assumption|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#leap-of-faith-assumption]]
		- these assumptions have a [[Growth Hypothesis|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#growth-hypothesis]] and [[Value Hypothesis|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#value-hypothesis]]
- how to startup
	- progress should be measured by [[Validated Learning|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#validated-learning]]
	- to achieve progress, adopt [[Build-Measure-Learn Loop|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#build-measure-learn-loop]] loop
		- hypothesize, predict, measure
	- kanban with **limit on works in progress at any stage**
- prioritize
	- systematically testing assumptions
	- connect tests with long term vision
	- everything that doesn't help with learning is wasted work
	- making progress means understanding value that product is actually providing users and figuring out the [[Engine of Growth|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#engine-of-growth]]
- etc
	- make [[Proportional Investment|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#proportional-investment]] when growing and scaling

- startup should
	- know where they are now
	- figure out how to get closer to ideal
- metrics
	- actionable
	- accessible
	- auditable

## Concepts
See [[Concepts|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts]]

## Notes

### vision

### 1 start
- goal of startup is to figure out **what to build** (as quickly as possible)
- startup is like driving a car, **you want to continuously steer** vs planning for a rocket launch where a single error could be a disaster
- this process is the [[Build-Measure-Learn Loop|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#build-measure-learn-loop]]
- true north, strategy, product

### 2 define
- a [[Startup|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#startup]] is an organization that is **building something in environments of extreme uncertainty**

### 3 learn
- [[Validated Learning|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#validated-learning]] is discovering truth about current and future prospectsl
- **real progress** in a startup is learning what work created value for users (anything else is waste)
- goal of learning is to find the point of intersectino btw startup vision and what customers want
- **EVERYTHING** that a startup is doing should be in the service of validated learning

- eg: IMVU had faulty assumptions about what users wanted (people did not want to learn new social network, people wanted to talk to their existing friends)

### steer

### 4 experiment
- if you can't fail then you can't learn
	- eg. Zappos beginning, take picture of other people's inventory and try to sell online to see if there is demand
		- source: [[The Lean Startup|dendron://highlights/books.the-lean-startup#^2eeoztglckjc]]
- to experiment, **hypothesize, predict, and then measure**
- two most important hypothesis
	- [[Value Hypothesis|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#value-hypothesis]]
	- [[Growth Hypothesis|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#growth-hypothesis]]

### 5 leap
- [[Leap of Faith Assumption|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#leap-of-faith-assumption]] is riskiest part of plan
- once assumptions are clear, build and validate
- to measure learning, use [[Innovation Accounting|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#innovation-accounting]] and [[Learning Milestones|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#learning-milestones]]
- after [[Build-Measure-Learn Loop|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#build-measure-learn-loop]], startup needs to decide to [[Pivot or Preserve|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#pivot-or-preserve]]
- [[Analogue|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#analogue]] and [[Antilogue|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#antilogue]] can be a useful framework in [[Leap of Faith Assumption|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#leap-of-faith-assumption]]
- priorities of a startup
	- be able to systematically test assumptions
	- connect present tests with long term vision
- as founder
	- figure out what parts of original plan were good and what parts need to change
	- **need to understand** what is responsible for startup growth
- nothing as effective as [[Genchi Gembutsu|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#genchi-gembutsu]] 
	- "see for yourself", talk to the customer

### 6 test
- create a [[Minimal Viable Product|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#minimal-viable-product]]
- early adopters will be suspicious if product too polished, time on polish can be waste of time
- types of MVPs
	- [[Video MVP|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#video-mvp]]
	- [[Concierge MVP|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#concierge-mvp]]
- when creating a MVP, don't waste time trying to fully solve problem
	- until you know your customer, you don't know what **quality** even is
	- #mw: doing things that don't scale
- **remove everything that doesn't contribute to learning**

### 7 measure
- startup needs to do 2 things
	- measure where they are now
	- figure out how to get closer to the ideal
- most startups, when asked if they're making the product better, will say yes but have no data to back it up
	- eg. we launched a few features and our numbers went up (but then subsequently went down again)
	- see [[The Lean Startup|dendron://highlights/books.the-lean-startup#^bw7mg6yq0k0g]]
- begin process of [[Innovation Accounting|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#innovation-accounting]]
	- 1: build mvp to gather baseline data
	- 2: tune [[Engine of Growth|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#engine-of-growth]] to get closer to ideal
	- 3: make decision to [[Pivot or Preserve|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#pivot-or-preserve]]
- when testing, test **riskiest assumption first**
	- #MW: deploy in IAD
- beware of [[Vanity Metrics|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#vanity-metrics]]
- focus on [[Cohort Based Metrics|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#cohort-based-metrics]] and [[Split Testing|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#split-testing]]
- kanban 
	- backlog, in progress, built, validated
- **story not complete until we have validated learning from it**
- have upper limit on items in any given stage #star
- metric focuses
	- actionable: establish cause and effect
	- accessible: concrete units 
	- auditable: everyone has access (ideally, team that owns product should also own this)
		- you should be able to **spot check data** (eg. talk to customers and see if user behavior confirms the data)

### accelerate

### 8 pivot
- startup **run rate is amount of pivots it has left**
- productivity is measured not in features released by the alignment of effort with value and growth
- **need clear hypothesis or can't decide about pivot**
	- eg. potbelly sandwich shop began as antique shop in 1977 
- things to measures registration, activation, rentention, referral
- types of pivots
	- zoom: focus on one from a whole
	- zoom out: expand feature
	- customer segment: b2b to b2c
	- platform pivot: change from app to platform or ice versa
	- technology: switch tech for same wndat
	- channel: direct vs cto
	- engine of growth: viral, sticky and paid
	- value capture: charge at diff point in chain
	- business architecture: high margin low volume vs opp

### 9 batch
- **small batch sizes help validate ideas quicker**
	- do continuous deployment
- same person during multiple function, take advantage of breadth of skills
	- corporate doesn't do this because of accountability hard
- **can't have too much work in progress,** in manufacturing line, fills up all the machines but no visible signs of this with knowledge work #star
- use hypothesis for what customer wants to work on batch and move forward

### 10 grow
- sustainable growth: new customer come from actions of old
- growth types:
	- word of mouth 
	- side effect of using product (eg fashion)
	- funded advertising
	- repeat purchase (eg lightbulb)
- startups don't starve, they drown #star
- engines of growths
	- sticky: rate of customer acquisition should exceed churn rate, can increase retention
	- viral: customers spread product, aim for coefficient of 1 (every customer will result in 1 more customer)
	- paid: cpa (cost per acquisition) lt ltv (life time value of customer)
- **focus on only one engine of growth at a time**
- **when making customer segment pivot, consider changing engine of growth**
- product market fit, Marc Horowitz, **customers pull product into mainstream** #star

### 11 adapt
- adjust processes and performance according to problem
	- #MW: cross the bridge when we get there
- small problems should have small response, large should have larger response
- root of every tech problem tends to be human #star

- use 5 whys
	- have everyone involved in incident present
	- avoid 5 blames
	- don't send baggage through system, tackle new prob
	- appoint 5 why master
- mistakes
	- be tolerant of 1st mistake
	- no 2nd mistake
- adopt [[Proportional Investment|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.lean-startup.concepts#proportional-investment]]
- failure is working on things that don't matter #star
- small batch sizes, quickbooks waterfall anti-example

### 12 innovate
- qualities of startup
    - **scarce but secure resource**
    - **ind dev auth**
    - **personal stake**
- in org, how to protect parent org from startup? manager will feel threatened

### epilogue
- frederick winsolw taylor's principles of scientific management #todo
- **see forest vanishing but can't see minds being wasted** #analogy
- nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all, peter drucker #quote
- 100 years, what techniques and believes will seem outlandish and stupid
