- if you can't fail, you can't learn

# Quotes

# Notes

### 1 start
- measure testable predictions
- drive car instead of rocket ship where single error is disaster
- build, measure and learn
- true north, strategy, product

### 2 define
- startup
- build new thing in uncertainty

### 3 learn
- discovered truth about current and future prospects
- don't make assumptions, 3d avatar and creating new social network assumption
- value means provision benefit to customer

### 4 experiment
- if you can't fail then you can't learn
- Zappa beginning, take picture of other people's inventory and try to sell online
- value and growth hypothesis
- value: does thing provide value
- growth: how new customer will discover thing
- concierge mvp: best mvp possible, guided

### 5 leap
- [] getting to plan b #book
- analogue and antilog
- analogue shows something will work: eg. People will listen to music outside
- antilog shows current bad behavior: eg. People won't pay for music
- genchi gembutsu: go see for yourself, saying used in Toyota

### 6 test
- create a mvp
- video: Dropbox 3 min video
- concierge: ceo personally attend one customer
- mechanical Turk: use people to answer

- remove everything that doesn't contribute to learning

### 7 measure
- don't be a zombie and just stumble along
- innovation accounting
- get data with mvp, this is baseline
- every effort should be aimed at improving a driver of growth
- one hypothesis and see if feature validated it
- if driver of growth not moving, pivot
- cohort analysis
- vanity metrics vs actionable metrics
- use cohort based metrics
- do split test metrics
- story not complete until we have validated learning from it
- metrics: actionable, accessible, auditable

### 8 pivot
- startup run rate is amount of pivots it has left
- measures: registration, activation, rentention, referral
- need clear hypothesis or can't decide about pivot
- potbelly sandwich shop began as antique shop in 1977 #eg

- types
	- zoom: focus on one from a whole
	- zoom out: expand feature
	- customer segment: b2b to b2c
	- technology: switch tech for same wndat
	- channel: direct vs cto
	- engine of growth: viral, sticky and paid
	- value capture: charge at diff point in chain
	- business architecture: high margin low volume vs opp

### 9 batch
- small batch sizes help validate ideas quicker, maybe not most efficient
- continuous deployment
- same person during multiple function, take advantage of breadth of skills, corporate doesn't do this because of accountability hard
- can't have too much work in progress, in manufacturing line, fills up all the machines #star

### 10 grow
- sustainable growth: new customer come from actions of old
- types:
	- word of mouth
	- side effect of using product (eg fashion)
	- funded advertising
	- repeat purchase (eg lightbulb)
- startups don't starve, they drown #star
- engines of growths
	- sticky: rate of customer acquisition should exceed churn rate, can increase retention
	- viral: customers spread product, aim for coefficient of 1 (every customer will result in 1 more customer)
	- paid: cpa (cost per acquisition) lt ltv (life time value of customer)
- focus on only one engine of growth at a time
- when making customer segment pivot, consider changing engine of growth
- product market fit, Marc Horowitz, customers pull product into mainstream #star

### 11 adapt
- use 5 whys
	- have everyone involved in incident present
	- avoid 5 blames
	- don't send baggage through system, tackle new prob
	- appoint 5 why master
	- be tolerant of 1st mistake
	- no 2nd mistake
	- proportional investment
- accuirvib failure successfully by working on things that don't matter #star
- small batch sizes, quickbooks waterfall anti-example
- net promoter score #todo

### 12 innovate
- qualities of startup
    - scarce but secure resource
    - ind dev auth
    - personal stake
- in org, how to protect parent org from startup? manager will feel threatened

### epilogue
- [] frederick winsolw taylor's principles of scientific management
- see forest vanishing but can't see minds being wasted #analogy
- nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all, peter drucker #quote
- 100 years, what techniques and believes will seem outlandish and stupid
- [] meetups and books


# Other
- agree on set of values
- prioritize speed over full implementation
- for design decisions, if you don't have data, defer to original decision
- disagree and commit
- playbooks for diff situations
- coes tool for the public

- ideas
- custom tshirt design
- universal links video
