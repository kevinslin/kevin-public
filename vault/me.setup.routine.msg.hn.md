### What's your routine?

I like to have a fairly regular routine with consistent time to wake up every morning. The typical day is divided into four phases: 

- morning: start of with yoga and focus on most important work before noon
- noon: take a breather with running, have lunch and read up on hacker news
- afternoon: more work, mix in nap and meditation to get through the afternoon
- evening: wind down, prepare for next day
