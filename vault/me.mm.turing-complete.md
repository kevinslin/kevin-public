> In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine (devised by English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing). This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete.

While two turing complete languages are in theory equivalent (that given enough time, they can compute the same things), in practice, this is not very useful (eg. css3 is [turing complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497146/is-css-turing-complete))
