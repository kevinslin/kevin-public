## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

Advocate for using a "linking your thinking" approach as an alternative to the "zettelkasten" method when it comes to maintaining a second brain

## Thoughts

Zettelkasten was a tool designed for a very specific purpose - helping the author produce more written content. It is now a hammer that is being tried for everything else, including a "life operating system".
