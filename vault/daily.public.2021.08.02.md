Got bit by a pitbull today during my run. Came at me when I stepped aside to the grass to let the owner pass. The owner did did not have any vaccination papers for the dog and said they got it from a friend. Also that the dog ran away last year. 

Got his number and then spent a few hours researching [[rabies|daily.journal.2021.08.02.rabies]] and talking to doctors and animal control.
