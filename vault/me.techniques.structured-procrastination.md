Structured Procrastination is the art of doing *productive* tasks while avoiding the task at hand. 

Procrastination seldom means doing nothing - merely not doing the thing that has to be done. To turn this into structured procrastination, have a long enough list of tasks that doing something further down on the list accomplishes avoiding the current task while also doing something worthwile.

> **structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception**, **since one is in effect constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself**.
