[What's the difference between process.cwd() vs __dirname?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9874382/whats-the-difference-between-process-cwd-vs-dirname)

process.cwd() returns the current working directory,

i.e. the directory from which you invoked the node command.

__dirname returns the directory name of the directory containing the JavaScript source code file
