## Summary
- source: {{fm.url}}

Design has shifted from photographs to hand drawn abstractions because sites like unsplash have made photographs more accessible and therefore less desirable. 

A landing page is about signalling. It is an example of the [[Red Queen Race|dendron://kevin-public/me.mental-models.red-queen-race]]. Using the same assets that everyone else does does not accomplish this. Hence the shift to abstract landing pages. 

With the introduction of DALL-E, abstract designs no longer serve this purpose, hence, design trends will change.
