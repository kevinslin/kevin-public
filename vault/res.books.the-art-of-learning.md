- [[Hermit Crab|dendron://kevin-public/me.mm.hermit-crab]] analogy, to grow, one must be vulnerable
- [[The Rival|dendron://kevin-public/me.mm.the-rival]] 
- to learn, you will fail and be dissapointed
- growth comes when you find your limits and go beyond

### 4 - loving the game

    - flow with what comes
    - use what comes to your advantage
    - create your own earthquakes

### 7 - changing voice 
- "numbers to leave numbers"
- improving at self through chess vs improving chess

### 12 - using adversity
- an earthquake during a competition sparked a period of intense concentration
- next step is to invoke an earthquake like concentration without the earthquake
- whenever you control two of the opponents limbs with one of your own, then you have advantage #star

### 13 - slowing down time
- relying on intuition and the unconcious in high level play

### 14 - the illusion of the mystical
- the superpower is perceiving more detail, which slows down time and allows you to perceive more frames than your opponen

## 3 - bringing it all together

### 15 - the power of presence
- even when positions were even, the first to cave to pressure in a chess match would lose
- the solution is to embrace the pressure

### 16 - searching for the zone
- interval training as the foundation to be good under pressure #star
    - eg. bike at 170 bpm, relax down to 144 bpm, and cycle every minute
- there is release knowing that full relxation is just a breath away from total concentration

### 17 - building your trigger
- waiting is life, we have to learn to wait
- build a trigger in the form of a routine that you do before you enter a state of presence
    - eg. if you're present playing ball with kid, make sure to meditate before that and use meditation as trigger for being present

### 18 - making sandals
- use dirty players as teachers who expose weaknesses in your mind
- accept reality and emotions, use it
- highest level performers need to be true to themselves
- formula
    - cultivate soft zone, be aware of feelings and ready to either hold or let go of whats arising 
    - turn weakness into strength, use emotion to fuel performance
    - find emotional triggers that lead to best performance
    - figure out how to manually trigger those emotions
    - condense those triggers until you can call them at will

### 19 - bringing it all together
- make small circles from single technique/idea 
    - keep condensing the movements 
- slow down time, make smaller circles on a group of techniques
