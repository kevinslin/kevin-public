<!-- ## People

## Quotes -->

## Notes

### intro
- values should help guide decision 
    - eg. when doing a deal, make more money or get partnership 
- if you see something and do nothing, that sets culture

- coaching vs direction, as a leader, you should do latter
- virtues vs values
    - virtues are what you do, values what you believe 

### revolution - toussaint louverture
- create shocking rules , beg questions why
    - eg. [[people.toussaint-louverture]], led slave army in haiti, but told them not to plunder 
- make decisions that demonstrate this 

### touissant applied
- rule must be encountered daily 
- [[people.tom-coughlin]], coach giants, show 5 min early or fine
- eg. sales story, follow 4c
    - competence (know the product), confidence (have point of view), courage, conviction 
    - most sales have wizard oz problem: people that lack courage, brain or heart

### way of warrior
- work must be meaningful
- [[people.ben-horowitz]] late for meeting, pay $10 per minute, respect entrepreneur time
- create memorable stories - [[#blood-geneology]]
- cisco ceo, if you cannot see car from hotel, it’s too expensive

### warrior II
- [[people.shaka-senghor]]
    - ran prison gang with stricter codde
        - hold constant study groups about self improvement, daily contact 
- understand culture by seeing how new people behave
    - ask them what is working or not working 
- enforce culture with actual ramifications
    - eg. no written performance, no bonus
- watch out for people weaponizing culture
    - eg. no take feedback at slack that was critical
- show people urgency
    - eg. met with people everyday, sometimes twice a day

### ghenghis khan
- [[people.genghis-khan]]
- meritocracy, loyalty and inclusion
    - conquered would share in future rewards 
    - part timers can get access to full time benefits  #MW

### inclusion
- quality of life is quality of questions
    - eg. why am i fat vs what does an intelligent man do to trim weight
- change framming
    - eg. don’t see me as outside but as one who will help you conquer the world
- fostering inclusion
    - involved in strategy, start with job description, complete integration
    - eg. test for helpfulness instead of hiring for women

### be yourself
- watch out for your flaws and design around them
- hire people that fit your culture
- checklist
    - will doing your virtue make a difference
    - does your virtue distinguish your culture
    - can you carry out this virtue?

### edge cases
- figure out when your culture doesn’t work: 
    - when right people are quitting, 
    - your top priorities are failing
    - your employees do something that is shocking
- bad employee personas: 
    - the heretic (always looks for faults)
    - the flake
    - the jerk
    - the prophet of rage (highly talented but need to be managed - don’t tell them behavior is bad but point out how their actions aren’t producing the right effect)
- decision making
    - everyone gets voice, leader decides
- disagree and commit, have this in organization to prevent bouncing around
- speed vs accuracy dilemma, there's always a tradeoff
- pushing decision down org chart leads to fragmentation 
    - #MW: eg. AWS
- consider [[mm.wartime-vs-peacetime-ceo]]

### Closing
- Trust
    - There are hard truth, give them new meaning
        - State facts
        - Own up to mistakes
        - Explain how this action is good for greater missio
        - eg. Gettysburg address, taking bloodiest casualties and giving a new meaning to the civil war
        - reminds me of [[Crucial Conversations|dendron://kevin-public/res.books.cruicial_conversations#^cDtMLqaHDlxz]] #MW
- Openness to bad nes
    - Encourage it 
    - Focus on issues
    - Regularly look for bad news
        - eg. Anything preventing you from getting your job done?
        - eg. What would you do if you were me
- Loyalty
    - eg. Data bricks: I will commit that there will be no surprises, you tell me if you are unhappy
- Cutture checklist
    - Culture design: align with your personality and strategy
    - orientation: make sure people are introduced to it
    - Shocking rules
    - Incorporate outside leadership if needed
    - Object lessons: have vivid stories
    - Makes ethics explicit
    - Give tenets deep meaning, make them stand out
    - Walk the talk
    - Make decisions that demonstrate priorities
