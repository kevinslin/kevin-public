There are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under our noses. One reason we don't see them is a phenomenon I call schlep blindness

Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but has passed into general use in the US. It means a tedious, unpleasant task.

No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them. Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing some clever software

ou can't start a startup by just writing code

schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty much what business consists of

And schleps should be dealt with the same way you'd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in

The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much of it is unconscious. Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps. That's schlep blindness

The most striking example I know of schlep blindness is [Stripe](http://stripe.com/),

For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was

Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe site began by asking "should we fix payments, or build a recipe site?" and chose the recipe site

That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable. In addition to their intrinsic value, they're like undervalued stocks in the sense that there's less demand for them among founders

Frankly, the most valuable antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance

In practice the founders grow with the problems. But no one seems able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders

the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make two mistakes that cancel each other out. They don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to

The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of the picture. Instead of asking "what problem should I solve?" ask "what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?" If someone who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that, Stripe wou
