## Welcome to my [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) ðŸŒ±

I'm **Kevin**, founder of [Dendron](https://dendron.so/) ([YCW21](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29176158)) - an open-source, local-first, knowledge base for developers. Our goal is to help devs access and structure all the information they have ever come across using plain text, markdown, and version control. 


As a point of reference, I made Dendron because I wanted a better way of managing my own corpus of **30K+ notes**. Dendron is the result of a decade of experimenting with different tools and systems. 

The end result is [[A Hierarchy First Approach to Note Taking|dendron://kevin-blog/blog.pkm.2020-08-24-a-hierarchy-first-approach-to-note-taking]], a system that helped me instantly access any information I've noted before. 

You are reading my personal site which is managed and published using Dendron. You can [clone this site locally](https://github.com/kevinslin/kevin-public-vault) or [make your own](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/4ushYTDoX0TYQ1FDtGQSg). 


## Navigating the Garden

The advantage of a garden is that it is non-linear and can offer much more context than a linear blog. This is also its greatest downside as it can be hard to know where to begin. If you want to ease into this experience and want a linear feed of blog posts, I would recommend starting off with the [[Blog|dendron://kevin-blog/blog]] hierarchy. 

If you are feeling more adventurous, you can learn about how this blog is structured via the [[blog schema|home.schema]] and go down other trails.
