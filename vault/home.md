## Welcome to my [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) ðŸŒ±

I'm **Kevin**. I'm a software engineer that's been obsessed with PKM for the last decade - mostly for personal reasons as I needed a tool that could help me make use of my own corpus of **+30K notes**. 

After a decade of experimenting, I found that existing workflows and tools  (sometimes) made it easy to create notes but past the 1K note threshold, made it [[impossible to find again|blog.pkm.2020-03-30-its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base]].

This led me to create my own workflow - [[A Hierarchy First Approach to Note Taking|blog.pkm.2020-08-24-a-hierarchy-first-approach-to-note-taking]]. This workflow, combined with custom tooling I created to facilitate it, **completely solved information overload** for myself, allowing me to easily create, organize and reference my own knowledge.

In 2019, I left my job at Amazon to focus on distilling everything I had learned about PKM to build [Dendron](https://dendron.so/) - a [tool for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) that helps **humans** manage **knowledge at scale**.

## About the Garden

Dendron is not just for storing knowledge but also for sharing it. This is why [publishing](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/4ushYTDoX0TYQ1FDtGQSg.html) is a first class feature in Dendron (this site that you're reading is published using Dendron). 

Dendron makes it easy to publish any subset of your notes using a custom open source nextjs template that compiles everything down to static HTML which you can host anywhere.
