Elasticsearch. It reaped the benefits of open source and now that its a publically traded company, is trying to control as much of its IP a possible. At least that's one way to read it. 

The other way is that the spirit of open source doesn't extend when big tech is coming in and that its no longer the same thing - kind of like how google earth and someone taking pictures when walking down the street isn't the same thing.

It is amazing how AWS is comming out as the good guy in this story. There are heroes and villains on both sides here.
