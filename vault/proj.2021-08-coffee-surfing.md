## Goal

Explore different coffee places in the area

## Context
<!-- Background information -->
According to my wife, I've been not going out as much ever since I started working full time on  [Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/). In order to catch up with friends, get out of the house, and do something that is still Dendron related, I've decided to go to a different coffee shop every week for conversations and work. 

## Success Criteria
<!-- milestones for this project -->
- [ ] visit 1 coffee shop every week for 1 month
- [ ] catch up with at least two people every month for 1 month

## Log
<!-- For longer projects, keep a rough log of major events-->
