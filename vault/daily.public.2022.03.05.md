Been a while since the last post. 

Seems like the process of all ~~blogs~~ gardens is to naturally decay without outside stimulus or constant upkeep. 

There's been lots of stimulus but no upkeep, hence present day affairs. This entry will mark a turn around (?) in these state of affairs. 

Some updates since the last entry in [[2021-08-14|dendron://kevin-public/daily.public.2021.08.14]]:

- [[Dendron|dendron://kevin-blog/home._ref.dendron-missions]] is continuing to grow: KPIs, community, and our team (just one person shy of double digits now)
- have been stung by two wasps
- writing less code and doing more of everything else (hiring, user interviews, planning, accounting, etc)
