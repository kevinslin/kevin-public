Running on low carbs.

# Carb Cycling
- source: [^lc0]

## Notes
- going between low carb and high carb days
- each cycle is a couple days long
- low insulin promotes fat burning?
- carbs important before and after workout for athletes
- don't do it if your just getting started with keto
- some people feel much worse when introducing carbs back in 
- might not be necessary for atheltic performance [^1]
- clinical trials of carb loading before performance show mixed results [^1]
- can take btw 4 weeks to 6 months to adapt

## Schedule
- ways of cycling
  - seasonal
    - october to march: 20g carbs per day
    - april to september: 100g carbs per day
  - training schedule
    - high intensity: 150g
    - moderate: 100g
    - rest: 20g

- runners: no carb, low carb and high carb days
  - no carb: easy day (1 per week)
  - low carb: regular training (rest of week)
  - high carb: hard workouts (2-3 times per week)
- recommendation
  - timed carb diet: consume carbs before and after workouts [^lc1]
  - eat carbs that are easy to absorb ahead of run (eg. banana)
  - eat foot with high glycemic index after a run
  -  30-60 grams of carbohydrate per hour for sports of longer duration [^lc2]
  -  2-2.5 hours (like marathon training, ultra marathons, ironmans) may benefit from higher intakes of up to 90 grams/hour. [^lc2]

- example of 100g carb day

  Breakfast:	Fried eggs and yogurt	28 grams carbs
  Snack:	1 cup mixed almonds/pistachios/cashews	16 grams of carbs
  Lunch:	Ground turkey Chili	18 grams of carbs
  Dinner:	Oven-baked salmon with root veggies	21 grams of carbs
  Dessert:	1 cup mixed blue/rasp/strawberries	16 grams of carbs


## Foods
- using *multiple transportable carbohydrates* (eg. fructose + glucose) better for activities of ~3h [^lc2]
- body can be taught to burn fat instead of glycogen for running [^lc2]
- typical store of glycogen is 1-2h [^lc2]

## Risks
- source: [^lc2]

- reduced immunity
- loss of muscle mass
- decrease ability to oxidize carbs during training
