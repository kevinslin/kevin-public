This site that you are reading from hosts is my digital garden.
It is deployed from my [this public repository](https://github.com/kevinslin/kevin-public-garden).

It is the composite of a few different repositories:
- [my public blog repo](https://github.com/kevinslin/kevin-blog.git): blog posts
- [my public garden repo](git@github.com:kevinslin/kevin-public.git): everything else that is public
- my private highlights repo: highlights from books/articles that I read (excerpts of this repo are embedded across a few notes)

It's deployed using AWS Amplify with the following [configuration](https://github.com/kevinslin/kevin-public-garden/blob/main/amplify.yml)
