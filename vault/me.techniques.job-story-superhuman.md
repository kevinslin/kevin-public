We thought about this hard for Superhuman, and did further reading. In particular, Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, was very helpful
In 2015, we came up with this positioning:

> For founders, CEOs, and managers of high-growth technology companies
>
> Who feel like their work is mostly email
>
> Superhuman is the fastest email experience ever made;
>
> Itâ€™s what Gmail could be if it were made today instead of 12 years ago
>
> Unlike Gmail -Superhuman is meticulously crafted so that everything happens in 100ms or less.
