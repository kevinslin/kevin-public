I've written a number of articles (eg. [[Google Cloud vs AWS Onboarding Comparison|blog.thoughts.2021-02-23-cloud-providers]], [[A Tale of Two Buckets|blog.aws.2019-07-17-tale_of_two_buckets]], etc) that for one reason or another have ended up on the front page of [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

A bunch of people have asked if I had any advice on how they could write content to do the same. 

What has worked for me is ranting about things that I feel are **absolutely ridiculous**. The fact that there are **a dozen different ways** to set S3 permissions , that google's idea of helping startups is to put you in touch with a sales rep - these are things that drive me to write long notes on because writing notes is how I cope and why I developed a [[system to manage|blog.pkm.2020-08-24-a-hierarchy-first-approach-to-note-taking]] the tens of thousands of notes that I have. 

Sometimes, my rants strike a chord and other folks pick up on it. Sometimes, I (like to) think that its because of my witty titles. The title part does make a difference on HN at least since its your five second pitch for folks to read your article.

When I first launched [Dendron](https://dendron.so), I published on HN with the following:
```
Show HN: Dendron – a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool 
```
This post got 7 points and 2 comments. 

A week later, I posted again with an alternative title
```
Show HN: Dendron – a roam like open source markdown note taking app 
```
This one got 127 points and 39 comments.

A lot of time, its just perseverance and hoping you catch people at a good time. That's all I have to say about it at the moment.
