I have a note called `me.check` that I keep pinned in [[window2|me.ref.vscode-layout#window-2]] of my personal workspace.
The purpose is to help me schedule ad-hoc tasks that need to be done within a week's timespan

It looks like the following

```md
## week

### sunday
- [todo]
- [check]

### monday
- [todo]
- [check]

### tuesday
- [todo]
- [check]
- [scheduled]

### wednesday

### thursday
- [todo]
- [check]

### friday
- [todo]
- [check]

### saturday
- [todo]
- [check]
```

### Workflow

1. At the beginning of the day, I take whatever is due today and move it into my daily
1. When I get a task that needs to be postponed to laster this week, I move it underneath the corresponding day of the week in my check note
1. At the end of the day, I move the current day section to the bottom
