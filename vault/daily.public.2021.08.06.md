## [[Dendron|area.dendron]]

Met up with my YC batchmates from W21. We get together once a month to talk about how we are. Turns out we're all in similar positions:
- working with hiring
- figuring out the path to profitability
- issues with delegating and time management

A good space to talk about similar struggles and happenings
