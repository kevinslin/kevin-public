# Dendron Seed Bank 

Building a Public Registry for General Knowledge

## Background - Product

Dendron is a hierarchal knowledge base that lets people organize and reference any amount of information. It is open source, local first, and built right into the IDE.

## 2

Dendron does for knowledge what excel does for numbers - we help people create and enforce a consistent structure for all their notes. 

## Background - Speaker

- Worked at AWS for 5+ years
- Started a few SaaS Businesses
- Independent consulting
- Work on Dendron full time since April 2020 
- Been thinking about this space for last decade

## Intro to Dendron

- open source, star us on github
- plaintext markdown with some augmentations
- lookup information in hierarchies using "cmd+l"
- quick demo

## Schemas and Hierarchy

- we have something called schemas
- there are a type system for how your notes are organized
- easy collapse things into one thing

## Demo

- ...

## Vaults

- Dendron partitions notes into vaults
- Each vault is different
- useful for work/personal

## Seed Bank

- Public Registry for General Knowledge
- Think NPM but for docs

## Why we built it

> "We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist" - Vannevar Bush, 1945

## Why we built it

- its hard to re-use knowledge
- most things locked away behind paywalls, ads or dense text
- subscription news letters - is this really the best way to stay up to date?

## Why we built it

- think code
- modular
- composable
- everythingwe made is built out of it

## Why we built it

- kept up to date
- just the facts
- comes with schemas about thinking of it 

## How it Works

- Initialize a vault as a seed
- Fill out details in `seed.yml`
- Use `dendron seed publish` to share it with the world

## How it Composes

- You can initialize your vault with seeds from many places
- You can reference content from seeds inside of your vault
- Remix content from different places

## Details

- have proper attribution for all seeds
- use iframe to show references to respect SEO

## Where we are

- We currently have seeds out
- Working on our publishing 

## Some Challenges

- versioning and dependency management
- building out a backlink tracker so you can see how influential your work is
- making the data in seeds both machine and human readable
- how to reconcile different schemas of the same domain
- dealing with duplicate content

## Milestones

- put seed bank out of alpha in middle of August
- work with some partners to put out first party content
- take feedback from the community

## QA
