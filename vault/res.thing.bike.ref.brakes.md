### Rim Brakes

> Rim brakes are an older style of brake that have slowly decreased in popularity since the introduction of disc brakes.

> Rim brakes are lightweight and compact, making them a popular brake choice for road cyclists who aim to be as aerodynamic as possible.

> Rim brakes usually sit above the wheel and when squeezed, apply friction to the braking surface along the rimâ€™s perimeter. This increased friction will decrease the turning speed of the wheels. 


#### Caliper Rim Brakes

> Caliper rim brakes are commonly found on road bikes as they are lightweight and efficient.
> There are two types of caliper rim brakes, single-pivot calipers and dual-pivot calipers.

> Single calipers have one pivot in the brake while duals pivot on two points.
> Their increased leverage provides dual pivot calipers with more modulation and power than a single-pivot caliper rim brake.










### Disk Brakes

> Disc brakes are one of the most powerful bike brake types on the marketplace. Although invented after the rim brake, they are arguably the most well-regarded brakes in cycling, due to their increased responsiveness and consistent performance in all weather conditions 

> Their braking strength and versatility enable disc brakes to accommodate mountain bikers on extreme offroading adventures and races.

- > pros:
    * Very powerful braking
    * Perform well in adverse weather & conditions
    * More efficient than other brake types
    * Long lasting brake pads
- > cons
    * Heavier than other types of brakes
    * More expensive to purchase
    * More technical to maintain
    * Reduce aerodynamic performance
