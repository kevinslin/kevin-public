In many situations, 20% of the work accounts for 80% of the output.  This is also known as the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). 

This could be finding a *good enough solution* for an intractable problem or refining a document down to just the key points - we focus on doing work that has the highest impact.
