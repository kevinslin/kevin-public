## [[Continuous Glucose Monitoring|proj.2021-07-continuous-glucose-monitoring]]

Some friends of ours were interested in the glucose monitoring thing and also signed up for levels. The one that is currently on the keto diet has a average blood glucose level of ~50 mg/dL.  He says he feels great. His glucose monitoring app is an angry red.

On the topic, my blood sugar dropped down to below 70 mg/dL today. This was at mile 7 for a ~10m run. Went up afterwards but definitely felt it when it was low.
