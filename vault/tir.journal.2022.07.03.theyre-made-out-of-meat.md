Two aliens are struck by disbelief at finding a planet inhabited by "sentient meat"

## Thoughts

We take it for granted but its actually quite a miracle that one, consciousness exists and that  two, it uses "meat" as its substrate. 

As incredulous as we might be to machines becoming "sentient", just as absurd is the idea that we ourselves, as "meat" possess these very qualities.
