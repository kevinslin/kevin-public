# Summary

Ray Dalio, founder of BlackRock, the world's most successful investment firm, talks about his process of using principles to guide both work and life.

# Review

Insightful book and very practically organized. Divided into three logical parts, with each major principle a chapter and individual key points being sub chapters. Dalio even summarizes the major points at the end of each part. The principles themselves range from novel (eg. radical transparency and recording ) to points you've probably read in similar books but the greater meta point behind all of them is the argument made for writing down your own principles and using them as algorithms to guide and continuously improve decision making. An insightful read and filled with good ideas.

# Takeaways
- make principles explicit and use them to guide decision making


# Key Points

## Life Principles

- what do you want? what is true? how do you achieve what you want knowing what is true?
- open minded and determined, you can get anything (**but not everything**)

- reality, accept it
    - MW: eg. bachelor trip, want people to wait up for me and sulk in the back about it instead of owning up to it <!--LOCAL_ONLY_LINE-->

- getting what you want
    - goals, problems, diagnose, solve, repeat
    - MW: basically ownership

- open minded
    - notice when you are arguing vs trying to understand

- people are wired differently
    - understand how people are
    - shapers, going from visualization to actualization

- making decisions
    - watch out for harmful emotions
        - MW: luke and century <!--LOCAL_ONLY_LINE-->
    - synthesize and ask good questions
    - imprecise estimation, 80/20
    - talk at different levels (big picture vs detail)
        - figure out if you are talking above the line or below it
    - **expected value calculation** when deciding
        - huge upside, low probability, no downside : go for it
        - good upside and good prob: go for it
    - simplify
        - MW: every principle engineer i've ever talked to has said this

## Work Principles
- being the person that wants a thing will **attract other people** that will want the same things
- to be great, can't compromise on things that are not compromisable
- be generous but this is **different then being fair**
    - MW: if i invite one person to a party, don't need to do it for everyone <!--LOCAL_ONLY_LINE-->
- if you are managing meeting, manage the conversation
- organize company orgs for goals instead of tasks
    - all comes down to incentives

## Other
- *satisfaction* of success is not achievement but **struggling well**
- ego and blind spots keep intelligent, hard working people out
- stick with something for 18mo to have it forever
