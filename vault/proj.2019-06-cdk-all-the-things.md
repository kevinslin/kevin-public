## Goal

Publish blog post about the CDK


## Context
This project goes over me writing the [[CDK All The Things: A Whirlwind Tour|blog.aws.2019-06-12-cdk_all_the_things]] article back in 2019.

It did well and was featured on the front page of HN among other places. It also was one of the things that led to AWS hiring me back as a consultant. 

This goes into the messy details of writing this blog post which in total, took me 8 hours to write.
