## Notes

- sometimes your users need to champion your product to the actual buyers inside the company
    - eg. hacker one, buyers donâ€™t like variable pricing so they raised the pricing which made buyers more comfortable with buying (high fixed cost better than variable cost)
- for users, there's two ways people can pay for your product:
    - money (subscription)
    - time (writing tutorials)
