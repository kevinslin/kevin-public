## Thoughts

This reminds me of something [[people.becky-weiss]] (one of my favorite people from my days at [[Aws|dendron://users/co.aws]]) used to say - design for the scale that you are today. Don't be quick to judge how things are built - they were built for the constraints of that particular time.
