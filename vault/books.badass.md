## Key Points

### Bigger Context
- most tools are used to serve a bigger context
    - Eg. Cool camera vs cool photographer
- Badass means developing expertise
- Badass users talk about what they do to users
- Don’t do faux badass with badges, need real skills 
- Don’t make a better x but  better user of x

- design for post ux ux
    - Eg. User shares picture, gets good comments that makes them want to do more
- how would your user compete against other users

### Curve

￼
- user ability with tool should also translate to ability in context

￼
- avoid the suck zone
    - User spend more time but not get more ability
    - Watch out for upgrades that bring users back into suck zone
- watch out for levelling off after suck zone
- Watch out for stuck zone

￼
- exercise: how does your user get stuck
    - Never publish a note
    - Never use links
    - Never use schemas
- Need to get past stuck zone

## Improvement

- definition of badass in your context
    - Given a sprint task involving new technologies an expert can deliver results and build expertise for the future
- for tool
    - Given a a sprint task with new tech, a user of Dendron can easily plan out their steps and make references for future use

## Experts

- if you can’t get to 95% proficiency in 3 practice sessions, its too much
- perceptual knowledge: what experts do but aren’t aware of doing (aka intuition)
- Help users gain this through surfacing patterns and cues
- Summary
    - Experts practice better
    - Experts develop perceuptual knowldege through high quality high quantity exposure with feedback

- make users want to get better
- Users don’t move ahead of “stuck zone”
- Gap of disconnect: achieving compelling context but being prevented by the tool
- Derailers: things that cause the gap of disconnect
    - Anticpiate
        - Snowboarding (things do suck the first day)
    - Compensate
- achieving mastery
- Create a performance path
    - What is needed for mastery
- exercxise: belt path
    - Install dendron
    - Open preview
    - Type
    - Lookup to create a new note
    - Create a wiki link
    - ....
    - Create a schema
    - Publish a site
