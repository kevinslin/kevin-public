  The ONLY job of a startup founder is getting to product market fit.

### Product Market Fit

An early stage startup founder wears many hats and does many things. But at the end of the day, your **only real job** is finding product market fit (PMF).

PMF is not just your only job but it is the job that only you, the startup founder, can do. Your investors can help introduce you to relevant people, successful founders can tell you how they found PMF, but ultimately, you are the only person that can determine PMF for your company. 

A big part of PMF is timing and luck - factors that are for most parts, out of your control. This is why even other founders that have found PMF are of limited help. 

What you can control is the market you're in, your team, and the unique insight that you bring as the founder. Your job as a founder is to leverage these strengths to get to PMF. 

Anything that is not in service of this does not matter in an early stage startup.
