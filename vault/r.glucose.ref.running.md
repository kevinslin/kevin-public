Running on low carbs.


- carb cycling [^lc0]
  - going between low carb and high carb days
  - each cycle is a couple days long
- low insulin promotes fat burning?
- carbs important before and after workout for athletes
- runners: no carb, low carb and high carb days
  - no carb: easy day (1 per week)
  - low carb: regular training (rest of week)
  - high carb: hard workouts (2-3 times per week)
- recommendation
  - timed carb diet: consume carbs before and after workouts [^lc1]
  - eat carbs that are easy to absorb ahead of run (eg. banana)
  - eat foot with high glycemic index after a run
  -  30-60 grams of carbohydrate per hour for sports of longer duration [^lc2]
  -  2-2.5 hours (like marathon training, ultra marathons, ironmans) may benefit from higher intakes of up to 90 grams/hour. [^lc2]
  - using *multiple transportable carbohydrates* (eg. fructose + glucose) better for activities of ~3h [^lc2]
- body can be taught to burn fat instead of glycogen for running [^lc2]
- typical store of glycogen is 1-2h [^lc2]
- risks [^lc2]
  - reduced immunity
  - loss of muscle mass
