- > EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization because both are considered non-cash items
- > When using EBITDA to measure the value of a company, any decrease in value of fixed assets is not accounted for and earnings would be overstated
- > it’s recommended that stakeholders use other financial metrics in addition to EBITDA
- >  it excludes some of the more discretionary or subjective expenses incurred by a company as a result of management’s decision
- > Taxes are also added back to earnings because there are situations that may be non-recurring in a year which drive taxes down or lead to an increase
- > EBITDA is often used as a tool to measure a company’s worth in a merger or acquisition transaction
    - > When a company buys another company, it is often buying the assets of that company and not its debt
