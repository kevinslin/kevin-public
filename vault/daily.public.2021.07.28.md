Updates from glucose monitoring.  I've lost weight. 7" in two weeks. I'm now at 148". I now see why people recommend low carb diets for weight loss. Long distance runners usually run lean so this isn't necessarily bad. 

That being said, I don't know what the healthy weight of a 6 foot asian male should be. Google says 140-177 lbs so I'll take that at face value. Realize this depends on additional factors but I feel great so far. 

That being said, I have noticed the lack of carbs when I do workouts. Its harder to do more intense runs. 

Did some research on [[low carbs and running|r.glucose.ref.running]] and the short of it is that it is hard. Body needs glucose for high intensity workouts (+60% VO2 max). It can learn to use fat for lighter workouts. 

This actually works well for ultra marathons since you go at a steady pace for a very long time. But for marathons and under, you actually need speed to compete seriously (at least I do). Plus, I'm on a timie budget with Dendron work so I usually limit my runs to 1h, maybe pushing close to 2h on long run. That means I rather run fast than long which makes the lack of glucose noticable. 

Maybe I will try [[carb cycling|r.glucose.ref.running#^lc0]]. Maybe switch exclusively to ultra marathons. My 800m track days are behind me anyhow. But the time for training runs for ultras is not something I can see happening anytime soon, if ever.
