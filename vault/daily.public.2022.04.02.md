Recently (aka 3 days ago) got a new macbook (m1 16" macbook pro) and decided it was a good chance to document my [[Laptop Setup|dendron://kevin-public/me.setup.laptop]] 

When setting up a new computer, my philosophy has been to use it as an exercise of digital spring cleaning - carry over what I need and bid good riddance to everything else. This means starting with a clean install and only downloading applications and files that I will use. 

There are many commendable properties of the m1 mac - one thing I noticed - Coming out of sleep is instant - maybe half a second faster than the intel based macbook that I was using before. When a process completes in under 100ms, it is [perceived as instant](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/536300/what-is-the-shortest-perceivable-application-response-delay) - the m1 mac coming out of sleep has crossed this threshold. 

Made an update to the garden by auto-pushing via [gh action](https://github.com/kevinslin/kevin-public/blob/main/.github/workflows/dendron.yml) #pif
