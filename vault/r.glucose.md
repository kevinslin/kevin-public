## Spikes
- source: [[Glucose|r.glucose#^iTMnEFyrGtCqaGRU]]

- consequences
    - fatigue, depression and anxiety
    - Damage tissues
- Extreme spikes
    - Heart disease
    - Diabetes
    - Metabolic dysfunction
    - Your body is becoming insulin resistant

## Details
- glucose can decrease by 5% during REM sleep (compared to non-rem sleep)
- extra pressure on sensor can cause low values

## Takeaway
- minimize post meal spike
- keep glucose variability low
- keep fasting glucose at low end 

## Raw Notes

- why high glucose can be bad
    - inflammation (immune response)
    - oxidative stress (free radicals in body)
    - glycation (glucose getting stuck)

- what causes high glucose
    - food: 15min
    - stress, cortisol tell liver to make and produce glucose
    - exercise
    - sleep, bad sleep cause higher cortisol

    - Alcohol
        - impairs liver ability to make glucose but also promote breakdown of stored glucose
        - shouldn’t affect in healthy individuals
        - those fasting or in ketogenic state, bad since glucose levels are already low
        - light and mild drinks doesn’t affect this

- exercise [^levels]
    - moderate aerobic activiy for 30min 3x/week over 8 weeks improves insulin resistance and glycemic control
    - 155lb person w/10% body fat
        - store 1,800 cal from glucose (2h exercise)
        - 63,000 cal from fat
    - insulin resistant obese people don't burn fat as effectively
    - 60% VO2 or lower use fat
    - 80% VO2 or above uses glucose
        - will result in glucose spike during and after exercise
        - this is fine and helps improve insulin resistance
    - recommendation
        - exercise more often in shorter bursts
