Updated my github profile today with a custom ~~profile~~ [readme](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

I knew this feature has been around for a while now but this is the first weekend I had a chance to play around with it. 

Its impressive to see what people have build around this - eg. custom visualizations for activity on github: [metrics action repo](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/)

End result here: https://github.com/kevinslin.
